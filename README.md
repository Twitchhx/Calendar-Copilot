# Calendar Co-pilot System

## My Choice: Python with JavaScript

### Reasoning

- **AI and NLP**: Python is better suited for implementing the AI and NLP components due to its powerful libraries and frameworks.
- **Backend Development**: Python with Flask offers a robust backend environment, especially with easy MongoDB integration through `pymongo`.
- **Web Interface**: JavaScript (React) for the front-end will provide a modern and interactive user experience.
- **Resource Sharing**: Used `Flask-Cors` to share resources between the backend and frontend.

## Architecture & Implementation Details

### 1. Backend (Python)

- **Framework**: Use Flask to create a REST API.
- **NLP & AI**: Initially used spaCy or NLTK to parse natural language input, but ended up using regular expressions with the module `re` to handle this part.
- **Database Operations**: Handle database operations with `pymongo`.

### 2. Front-End (JavaScript)

- **Framework**: Develop a responsive web page using React.
- **Interaction**: Implement form submission and interaction with the backend API.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)

- **Setup**: Set up a MongoDB cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
- **Database**: Create a database called `tutorDB`.
- **Collection**: Create a collection for tutor profiles called `tutors` and store availability data.

By leveraging the strengths of both Python and JavaScript, I created a robust and efficient Calendar Co-pilot system that meets all the project requirements.

## Areas of Improvement

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Implement more interactive and visually appealing feedback mechanisms to enhance user experience.
- **Deployment**: Use Heroku for the backend and Vercel for the frontend.
- **Advanced NLP**: Use a more robust NLP model for more accurate mapping of the tutorâ€™s natural language to time slots.
